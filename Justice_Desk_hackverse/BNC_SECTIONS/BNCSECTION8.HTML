                                        <p><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The law ensures that both fines and imprisonment in default are proportional to the offence and the offender's ability to pay.<br>

                                        <p><strong>Prevention of Excessive Punishment: </strong>By capping the default imprisonment at one-fourth of the maximum sentence for the offence, the law prevents the punishment from becoming overly harsh.<br>

                                    <br>
                                    BNS-08 establishes a framework for imposing fines and outlines the consequences for non-payment, including imprisonment. It provides the Court with flexibility to impose fines of appropriate amounts and ensures that any imprisonment for default is proportional, just, and within specified limits. This approach balances the enforcement of penalties with fairness and prevents excessive punishment.</p><p></p><br>
